                        <p>This will be my first webpage. So far im doing good going back and forth between pages to see certain elements and tags. Currently doing this assignment is making me understand more on how to structure an HTML page.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                A thing I learned is currently this ordered list i am using to state the thing i have learned.
                            </li>
                            <li>Another thing i learned is just how HTML pages work more i remember being younger in class and would hit inspect element and see all the coding for the page and not have a clue about anything so for me to understand something about it is pretty cool.</li>
                        </ol>

                        This lab is about CSS so far im liking it. My past lab i learned how to structure a website and it was pretty fun. Getting to understand HTML. I have not received feedback on my last lab but i think i did well and tried my best. I also used an ID selector on this paragraph.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     So far im liking this lab and being able to style my website with <span class="highlight">CSS</span> still have to learn certain things but being able to use the
                     <span class="highlight">span tag</span> is very neat.
                    </p>
<h3>What i learned</h3>
<ol>
