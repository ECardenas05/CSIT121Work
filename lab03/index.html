                        <p>This will be my first webpage. So far im doing good going back and forth between pages to see certain elements and tags. Currently doing this assignment is making me understand more on how to structure an HTML page.</p>
                        <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                A thing I learned is currently this ordered list i am using to state the thing i have learned.
                            </li>
                            <li>Another thing i learned is just how HTML pages work more i remember being younger in class and would hit inspect element and see all the coding for the page and not have a clue about anything so for me to understand something about it is pretty cool.</li>
                        </ol>
